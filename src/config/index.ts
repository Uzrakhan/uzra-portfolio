      Hi, Iâ€™m Uzra Khan, a passionate and dedicated self-taught Fullstack Developer. I recently focused my learning on the modern web development stack, including **React/Next.js for the frontend** and **Node.js/Express for the backend**.

      Although I don't have formal, paid work experience, I have channeled all my effort into building **real-world, hands-on projects** that demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and deploy fullstack applications.

      I thrive on turning complex problems into clean, efficient code and am eager to join a team where I can contribute my strong skills in **UI/UX implementation, API integration, and database management** while continuing to learn and grow.
